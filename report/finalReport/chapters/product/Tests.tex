The model classes have some of the most interesting functions and algorithms of
our program. The most advanced functions in the model are those regarding path
finding. The task of finding a path from one node of the graph to another,
takes many different kinds of input. Here is a list of the tests we ran on the
model class:
%TABLE
The tests are chosen so that they test for different input. But they are also
chosen so that they test the logical problems our path finding algoritm might
run into. In order to test these problems proberly, we constructed some simple
testdata that we knew we could relay on:
%IMAGE OF TESTGRAPH
Here is shown a
visualization of the graph our testdata constructed. The graph is constructed
so that we can test the many different problems that might occur on a small and
reliable data set.
