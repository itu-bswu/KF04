\chapter{Worksheets}
For this project we made a meeting document for all our meetings. We used
these to make sure we kept to agreements, homework, had structured meetings. It
was important for us to have these, because we wanted to have something to fall
back on if we had disagreements and for us to have an easy way of being on top
with everyone's homework. They are all written in Danish, becuase our meetings
happened in Danish.

The documents are all structured in the following way: 
\begin{itemize}
  \item Leader of meeting
  \item Keeper of minutes
  \item Homework done before today
  \item Work to be done during the meeting
  \item Summary of the meeting
  \item Homework
\end{itemize}

All of our meeting documents can be found in appendix \ref{APP-WS-MD} on page
\pageref{APP-WS-MD}.
