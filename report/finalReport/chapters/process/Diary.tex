\chapter{Diary}
In this project we have kept two types of diaries. One type in our meeting
documents and one in a spreadsheet. The meeting document diary was done from
meeting to meeting, so that we kept track of what everyone had done before each
meeting.

The spreadsheet diary was kept as a seperate document where we wrote down
whenever we had done something outside of meetings. We were not so dedicated to
writing down everything we did in this diary, so it ended up being incomplete.
We have included it anyway though, as we feel it has been a part of the process.

Our worksheets can be found in \ref{APP-WS} on page \pageref{APP-WS}. They are
written in Danish, as we had all of our meetings in Danish. The spreadsheet
diary is in appendix \ref{APP-SS} \class{\nameref{APP-SS}} on page
\pageref{APP-SS}. The spreadsheet diary is also written in Danish.
