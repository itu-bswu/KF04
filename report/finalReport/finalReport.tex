\chapter{Preface}
\label{PRE}
This report is the result of a project at the bachelor in Software Development 
on the IT University of Copenhagen spanning from early March 2011 to late May
2011. The project was given as a first semester probject in groups of 4 to 5
randomly picked students. 2,5 months of the semester was set aside for the
project. The time not spent on the report was used on coding, thorough testing
and bugfixing of the actual program.

\chapter{Product conclusion}
\label{PRC}
We believe our product live up to the project requirements described in chapter
\ref{BG} \class{\nameref{BG}}. Our program also runs fast enough when using the
interface. We tested this on both a fast computer and an older, slower computer
and we did not feel it was cumbersome to use the program, even on the slower
computer. We did not thoroughly test this however, and we cannot guarantee that
there will not be circumstances in terms of RAM-usage where our program will run
slowly.
 
The system tests were done on a Windows 7 computer and because of this, we
cannot be certain that all features work on other operative systems. However, 
two of our group members use MacOSX and they have experienced no problems 
with our program.

We did all of our testing internally. For a even more thorough testing of our
software, we could have asked other groups to test the software for us, so that
we could get a different look on the tests. We did no usability testing
throughout the project, and while our user interface is simple, we should have
tested to make sure we designed our interface in the best way possible.

\section{Issues in the software}
\label{PRC-BUGS}
We have discovered a few bugs our software that did not show itself through our
testing, but instead manifested with regular use of the software.

We have a bug in our zoom-function, which enables the user to zoom very far in
by zooming in, then resizing the window. This caused the program to be locked at
a very far zoomed in view, but we chose to let the user zoom out when they are
zoomed far in. The problem with zooming too far in can still happen, but the
view is not locked when it happens.

\section{Future features}
\label{PRC-FF}
If we had had time, we would have included more features in our program. We feel
our program could still do with some fine tuning for it to be of real use
outside of living up to the requirements.

We would have liked to have implemented a ``road search'' function, enabling the
user to search for the name of a road and place a marker there. In addition, we
would have like to implement the option for the user to view a route description
with turns.

To make the map look nicer, we attempted to implement a function for the map to
create a ``border'' splitting up the land and sea, so that it was more obvious
what is land and what is water. We would also have liked to make a logo for our
program, but we did not get around to implementing it.
